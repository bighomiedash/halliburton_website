# Biography:
# ---
My name is Devin Halliburton and I am a dynamic tech professional with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. From an early age, I have had a keen interest in technology, which led to a deep exploration of various programming languages and tools.

With a solid foundation in languages like Python, Java, C, and R, I have been able to hone skills in creating efficient and scalable solutions across different platforms. 

Throughout this website, you will be able to access a showcase of the work I have completed in MATH-230: Data Visualizations and Computing. From generative art to my final course project, there are many projects to be viewed. I hope you enjoy the website, just as much as I enjoyed creating it!
